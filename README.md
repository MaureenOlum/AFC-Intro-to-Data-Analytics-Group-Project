# Intro-to-Data-Analytics-Group-Project
For the project, we were provided with a dataset to analyze using the skills learned in the course, present our findings for each project question by creating visualizations and dashboard in Tableau Public to help answer the project questions.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains the daily number of webpage visits for 1,500 Wikipedia webpages starting on 2016-01-01 until 2016-12-31.

Dataset source: Kaggle.com

# Project Questions
From the project questions, we answered three questions.
1. what were some of the most trending search topics on Wikipedia on the following days? Using the provided dataset, can you show some evidence to support your answer? a- New year's day b- November 8, 2016.
2. Based on the provided dataset, which day(s) of the week is/are the most popular for visiting wikipedia?
3. Based on the dataset provided, which device type is used more frequently for visiting wikipedia i.e. desktop or mobile devices?

Hint: For some of the pages in the dataset, it is possible to distinguish whether the visits to the page came from a desktop or a mobile device. For example, consider Barack Obama's wikipedia page:
Barack_Obama_en.wikipedia.org_desktop_all-agents : these visits came from desktop devices.
Barack_Obama_en.wikipedia.org_mobile-web_all-agents: these visits came from mobile devices.

# Tableau visualization
